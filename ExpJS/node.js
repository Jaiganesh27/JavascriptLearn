// node js server side javascript runtime environment
// node js is single threaded and it has  evenet looping  concepts to 
// leads it makes a asynchronous programming.



// synchronous and asynchrounous
// synchronous - server handles one request at a time . and it will take another
// until it finishes it before received request.
// asynchronous - node with asynchrounous and single threaded it firstly took the request an 
// send it to the api before it finishes it will take another request and put it into the 
// event looping when the first one respose arrives it took the response from server 
// and send it back to the requested client.

// sync = php 
// async = node


// express 
//  1)  express do all the things node have and also will run
//  top of the node it is framework and have extra feautres to easy the node and api works.
